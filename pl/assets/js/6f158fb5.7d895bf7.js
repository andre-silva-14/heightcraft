However, terrain features vary wildly. A model trained on Swiss Alps data might not perform well on Martian crater data.\\n\\nBy training a custom model, you teach the AI to hallucinate details specific to your target biome.\\n\\n## Step 1: Prepare Your Dataset\\n\\nYou need a set of high-resolution heightmaps. These will be the \\"ground truth\\".\\n- **Format**: `.tiff` or `.png` (16-bit or 32-bit preferred).\\n- **Structure**: Place them all in a single directory.\\n\\n```bash\\nmkdir my_dataset\\ncp /path/to/high_res_tiffs/*.tiff my_dataset/\\n```\\n\\n## Step 2: Run Training\\n\\nUse the `--train` flag to start the training process. Heightcraft handles data augmentation and splitting automatically.\\n\\n```bash\\nheightcraft --train \\\\\\n  --dataset_path ./my_dataset \\\\\\n  --epochs 50 \\\\\\n  --batch_size 16 \\\\\\n  --learning_rate 0.0001 \\\\\\n  --pretrained_model my_custom_model.h5\\n```\\n\\n- `--epochs`: How many times to iterate over the dataset. 50-100 is usually good.\\n- `--pretrained_model`: The output path for your new model.\\n\\n## Step 3: Upscale with Your Model\\n\\nOnce training is complete, you can use your new model to upscale low-resolution inputs.\\n\\n```bash\\nheightcraft low_res_input.png \\\\\\n  --upscale \\\\\\n  --pretrained_model my_custom_model.h5 \\\\\\n  --upscale_factor 4 \\\\\\n  --output_path high_res_output.png\\n```\\n\\n## Results\\n\\nYou should see sharper edges and more plausible details compared to bicubic interpolation or the generic model.\\n\\nHappy upscaling! \ud83d\ude80"}]}}')}}]);
